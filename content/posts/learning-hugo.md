Hugo's static site generator has a very good quick start section that got me up and running with the basic structure but I soon wanted to go a bit further forward and the documentation wasn't that much adapted to my specific needs, so I'm taking a few notes about the most important concepts from my point of view:

To start I would split these core concepts into **content** as information structure, and **theme** as styling the structure because I want to have my theme to match my current website style.

### Content

Hugo defines two types of contents:

1. Single Pages
2. List Pages
